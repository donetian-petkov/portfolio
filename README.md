# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, which contains a brief introduction and a list of several frontend projects I have made. 

The images on the site are interactive - hovering over the ones in the Projects section reveal another screenshot of the said project via CSS animation. 

I have used BEM as best as I can for the CSS and AwesomeFonts for the social media icons. 

## Installation
